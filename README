CTNETSTRINGS IS EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE - DON'T USE IT IN PRODUCTION.

This project is aimed to provide a simple tnetstrings implementation in
top of my C Data Structures library. I don't have plans to keep this
library on par with Zed's canonical implementation (or any other).

This library requires to be linked against the C Data Structures library.
